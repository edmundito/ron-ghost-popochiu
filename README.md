## About
This is a little game I created in Godot to test the [@carenalgas/popochiu](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu) adventure engine. It is based on an old series of freeware point-and-click adventure games called [Reality-on-the-Norm](https://www.realityonthenorm.info).

## Requirements
1. Godot 3.5
2. Popochiu 1.x
